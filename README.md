# client-seed
Basic client application with an express server using vite, vue 3 and ts 5. I stole a lot of things from Chris Case, thank you.

`npm run dev` will get you going

to test before prod
`npm run build`
`npm run start`

I plan to add in an express router for api shenanigans, have not made anything from this yet so might tweak it as I learn what I messed up
